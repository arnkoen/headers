This repo contains small and simple single header utilities.
To use them, drop them into your project, #define UTILNAME_IMPL in one c file and include them.
For licensing information and credits, please have a look at the top of the respective header.
All of this mini libs should work on Linux(gcc) and Windows(cl), I don't own a mac and rarely use other platforms.
